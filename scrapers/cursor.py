Here's a Python script that uses the `requests` library to fetch HTML from the specified URL and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the required article information. The script will output the extracted data as a list of dictionaries.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# URL of the target webpage
url = "https://cursor.com/blog"

# Fetch the HTML content from the URL
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.text

# Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

# List to hold the extracted articles
articles = []

# Find all article elements (adjust the selector based on the actual HTML structure)
article_elements = soup.find_all('a', class_='relative justify-between border-brand-borders dark:bg-brand-medium-black')

for article in article_elements:
    title = article.find('h2').text.strip()  # Extract the title
    link = article['href']  # Extract the link (relative URL)
    full_link = f"https://cursor.com{link}"  # Construct the full URL
    # Extract the publication date if available (this example assumes it's not available)
    date = None  # Modify this if the date can be extracted from the HTML

    # Append the article data to the list
    articles.append({"title": title, "link": full_link, "date": date})

# Output the extracted data
print(articles)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import Libraries**: The script imports the necessary libraries, `requests` for fetching web content and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML.
2. **Fetch HTML**: It sends a GET request to the specified URL and retrieves the HTML content.
3. **Parse HTML**: The HTML content is parsed using `BeautifulSoup`.
4. **Extract Articles**: The script looks for all article elements using a CSS selector that matches the structure of the articles in the provided HTML. It extracts the title, link, and date (if available).
5. **Construct Full URL**: The script constructs the full URL for each article since the links in the HTML are relative.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the list of dictionaries containing the article information.

### Note:
- Ensure you have the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4
  ```
- Adjust the CSS selectors in the script if the actual HTML structure differs from the provided example.
